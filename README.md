# System Description

## A) Key System Features

1. **Gitflow Visualization**

   - The system will provide a visual representation of the Gitflow process, including branches, commits, and merges. This will help users better understand the flow of their code changes and the structure of their repositories.

2. **Assistance with Conventional Commits**

   - The system will assist users in creating conventional commits by providing templates and prompts for commit messages following the conventional commit standards (e.g., feat, fix, etc.).

3. **Branch Management**

   - Users will be able to easily manage their branches, including creating, renaming, merging, and deleting branches directly from the interface.

4. **Integration with Git Commands**

   - The system will integrate with Git commands, allowing users to perform actions such as committing, pushing, pulling, and merging without needing to switch to a terminal.

5. **Cross-Platform Support**

   - As the system will be developed with Tauri, it will support multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing a consistent experience across platforms.

## B) System Context

The system will be applied in the context of software development, particularly for developers who use Git for version control. It aims to simplify the Git workflow, providing a user-friendly interface for managing branches, commits, and other Git-related tasks. The system will be a valuable tool for both individual developers and teams, helping them maintain a clean and structured commit history while adhering to best practices.

## C) Potential Stakeholders

1. **Individual Developers**

   - Developers who use Git for version control and want a tool to simplify and visualize their workflow.

2. **Development Teams**

   - Teams that need a consistent and structured way to manage their branches and commits across projects.

3. **Software Studios**

   - Studios or companies that want to provide their developers with a standardized tool for Git version control.

4. **Open Source Contributors**

   - Contributors to open source projects who want to maintain a clear and organized commit history.

## D) Existing Similar Systems and Differentiation

There are existing tools like GitKraken and SourceTree that provide graphical interfaces for Git. However, the proposed system differentiates itself by focusing on the Gitflow methodology and conventional commits. It will be lightweight, developed with Tauri, and integrated directly with the operating system, offering a seamless and efficient experience for developers. The tool will also be free and open-source, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
